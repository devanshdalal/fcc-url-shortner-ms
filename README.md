#FCC 

This project is to fulfill the requirements for the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/url-shortener-microservice">URL Shortener Microservice Project</a> on Free Code Camp.

##User Stories:
* I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
* If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
* When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
